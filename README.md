# torchnets

This is just a small project that I started to understand more about the
construction of neural networks, particularly for computer vision. TL;DR: it
helped a lot.

This python-installable package runs on pytorch (I try to keep it compatible
with the latest version) and implements a variety of famous neural nets from
recent deep learning history. For each model, I try to cite the relevant paper
that introduced it, and with any luck this will be a nice archive of neural net
examples.


_**DISCLAIMER** This package is a personal experiment. Use the networks within
at your own risk. These networks are not distributed with pre-trained weights._
